# Reinforcement Learning Projects
In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the [CS294-112 course](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) homework about DeepRL offered by _UC Berkeley_ in Fall '18.
Specifically, this course covers implementation offerings of the following algorithms:
1. **Imitation Learning** with DAgger
2. **Policy Gradient** with variants: vanilla, reward to go, reward normalized, baseline average, baseline estimation w/ neural network
3. **Q-Learning + Actor-Critic** incl. Double DQN
4. [**Model-based RL**](hw4/) with a dynamics model and MPC
5. **Advanced topics**
    1. [**Exploration**](hw5/exp/) with histogram, RBF-Kernel, EX2
    2. **Soft Actor-Critic** with Maximum-Entropy method
    3. [**Meta-Learning**](hw5/meta/) with feed-forward / GRU based contextual policies
